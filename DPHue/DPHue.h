// The "name" of the Hue controller, as returned by the API
// This can actually be changed via the Hue API if necessary,
// but I didn't implement that feature.

// Properties you can probably ignore

// Both getURL and putURL are automatically generated based on
// data returned from the controller.
// readURL is the URL that returns data (controller config, lights)

// This will attempt to register a new username with the Hue controller.
// This will fail unless the physical button on the Hue controller has
// been pressed within the last 30 seconds. The workflow for this method
// is a loop: tell the user to press the button on their controller, call
// this method, then check self.authenticated. If NO, keep calling this
// method. Upon success, the new username is assigned to self.username.

- (void)writeAll;

// Triggers the Touchlink feature in a Hue controller, which causes it to
// pair with all lamps it can find, even thoughs that belong to another
// controller. To limit the possibility of "stealing" someone else's lamps,
// the range of this function is limited (by Philips, in the controller firmware)
// to a short distance from the controller.
// Calls block when a response is received from the controller.
